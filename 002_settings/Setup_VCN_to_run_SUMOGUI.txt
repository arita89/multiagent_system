## Guide to Connect to Server ?atcremers50" through VNC Viewer and work with SUMO graphical user interface

Following commands have to be run either on:
Local machine (local), your own computer
Remote host (host), atcremers50 , usually in command line

required installations:
*carla (host) - need the proper environment set up
*sumo 1.4.0 (host) - installed 
*sumo-gui (host)- installed 
*netedit (host)- installed 
*vnc (eg realVNC, depends on the os of the local machine) (local)
*x terminal (eg XQuartz, depends on the os of the local machine)  (local)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# (local) open terminal and run 
# this connects port 2000 on host to 2000 on local (no idea why it is needed, probably not)
> ssh -p 58022 s0014@atcremers50.informatik.tu-muenchen.de -NL 2000:localhost:2000

# tells ssh to connect on port 58022, which is a security feature (non standard port on host for listening to incoming ssh requests, usually it is port 22)
# this needs to be done every time before you connect with vnc!
> ssh -L 5910:localhost:5910 s0014@atcremers50.in.tum.de -p 58022
> ssh -L 5911:localhost:5911 s0014@atcremers50.in.tum.de -p 58022
 
# on the host initialize a X server, which draws output to display number 10 (usually on port 5910)
# any time the x server is gone (broken pipe error, disconnected or something similar), you need to start it again on the host.
# so here the command to start it in background mode &
> xinit /usr/bin/startxfce4 -- :10 &

# redirects display port 10 to autoport 5910 and allo vnc in backgrond mode (this is where the display runs :10 = port 5910)
#> x11vnc -display :10 -autoport 5910 &
> x11vnc -display :10 -autoport 5910  -forever&


# (local) open local VNC viewer 
# type  localhost:10 and connect
# you should see atcremers50 remote desktop!


# (host-desktop) open the terminal
> tmux
> ctrl+b + %

#on one tmux page 
> xterm
# pops another terminal window
# without this the town from carla doesnt load
# on (host-popped up terminal)
> cd /storage/remote/atcremers50/ss21_multiagentcontrol/Carla_0.9.11/
> conda activate <ENV_WITH_CARLA>
> DISPLAY= ./CarlaUE4.sh -opengl

# on the other tmux page
# go in carla folder 
>cd /storage/remote/atcremers50/ss21_multiagentcontrol/Carla_0.9.11/PythonAPI/util
# and load town
>python3 config.py --map Town04
# go to sumo folder
>cd ../../Co-Simulation/Sumo/
# and run 
>python3 run_synchronization.py examples/Town04.sumocfg  --sumo-gui

# the SUMO-GUI should open in all its glory
# in the edit options of SUMO-GUI there is the button "open in netedit"
